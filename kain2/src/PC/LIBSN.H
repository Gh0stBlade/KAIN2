** FILESERVER FUNCTIONS:
**
** NOTE: For PCread and PCwrite do not load files by passing extreme
** values for count as you might on UNIX as this will cause the full
** amount specified to be transferred - the file will be padded to
** that length with zeroes which may over-write memory beyond the
** end of the file.
**
** If you are unsure of the length of a file which you are about
** to read into memory then perform a
** 	len = PClseek( fd, 0, 2);
** This will set len to the length of the file which you can then
** pass to a PCread() function call.
